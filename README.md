# CURRENT RELEASE

**Neopolitan** - Vanilla, with Chocolate and Strawberry : All modlets collected and combined into a single all-in-one collection modlet for easy installation:

<https://github.com/XelaNull/7DTD-Neopolitan/blob/master/RELEASES/2021-15-02_173243-7DTD-Neopolitan.zip>

<https://github.com/XelaNull/7DTD-Neopolitan/blob/master/RELEASES/2021-15-02_173228-Modlet_Collection-Shouden.zip>

## Description

This repository is for a script I wrote to package up the modlet collection that I use on my server. At the time of this creation, it houses just under 85 modlets that are actively being used on my Sanity's Edge 7DTD server. These mods are curated to work well with A19.3 (b6) and are active in use on the aforementioned server.

## Purpose

The purpose of this is to create a zipfile of a large collection of modlets that are known to work well with each other. This makes it easy for someone who doesn't have the time or desire to sort through hundreds of different modlets to find the best and then spend the time to ensure that each work together well.

## Vanilla Plus

This Modlet Collection should be considered Vanilla+.

These modlets are selected for their Quality of Life (QoL) improvements over vanilla gameplay. There are no giants, rainbow zombies, flying insects, or substantial changes to gameplay. Anyone familiar with and who enjoys playing the vanilla game would be able to play this collection comfortably. _I'm confident after playing this collection, you'll find many or most of the modlets near-requirements for any future games of your own._

## CREDITS

All credits go to the original mod author. Most modders learn to create their own modlets by looking at the work of others. In some cases, code is copied to create a new modlet. Due to this, each modder is essentially standing on the shoulders of other authors. Most in the modding community, myself included, welcome others to look at how a modlet was created and to use this code to any extent, provided that credit is provided back to the author whose work yours is based off of. In the spirit of this community, I've notated each author above and always ensure within the ModInfo.txt file of each modlet to retain the original author's information, even in cases where I create a totally new modlet. This collection is meant to be nothing more than what it claims to be: A collection of my own and other people's hard work put together in a single zip file to make it easy for players and server administrators to easy install our work into their games. Enjoy.
